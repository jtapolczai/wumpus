-- |Returns all the cells in an agent's sight cone.
--  To be in an agent's sight cone, a cell has to fulfil three criteria:
--
--  * the Euclidean distance has to be small (depending on the world's light),
--  * it has to fall into the agent's POV (90Â° in the agent's direction), and
--  * it has to be unobstructed, \"unobstructed" meaning that each cell along
--    at least one path from the agent has to stay close to the direct line.
